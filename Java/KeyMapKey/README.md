## Purpose
This code sample is intended to help consultants learning Java by providing a relatively small, 
contained example that demonstrates basic concepts.

In addition, the broader community of developers is invited to comment, discuss, and challenge all
this so those learning Java benefit by understanding the trade offs and varying viewpoints that are
normal regarding code style.

All should feel free to change this code so long as all unit tests pass.  If you want to discuss,
please use the Collaborate page for this project.

If you use a local Jenkins, running against your local git repo, you can set up triggered builds.  See [Collaborate](https://)
